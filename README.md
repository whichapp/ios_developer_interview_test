iOS Developer Interview Test
============================

### Tasks

- Present data in table view
- Send User Id from table view to detailed view
- Present user details
- Send email using default email application
- Display Images 
- Format images
- Final testing and debugging 

### Footnote

Start from first task, move to next one only when you are sure it's working up to this point. It's better to see some results than nothing at all.
 
Results are more important than playing by the book. Make sure we can see result and if you have enough time refactor and optimise your code.
 
Some tasks maybe not as simple as it seams. We assuming you already know basics, but that being said try simple approach first as some tasks as as simple as it seams :)
 
Adding extra effects to views, user friendly navigation and tasteful formatting will earn you additional ranks.
